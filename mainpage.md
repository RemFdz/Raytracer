# Raytracer Epitech

Welcome to the documentation of the Raytracer Epitech. This project is an implementation of a graphics rendering engine capable of generating realistic 3D images from scene descriptions.

## Introduction

The Raytracer Epitech is a project carried out as part of the training at Epitech. It aims to teach the fundamental concepts of 3D modeling, computer graphics rendering, and computer programming.

## Features

- Rendering of geometric primitives such as spheres, planes, and triangles.
- Support for diffuse and ambient lighting.
- Reflection and refraction models to simulate shiny and transparent surfaces.
- Shadow casting to add realism to the scene.
- Scene configuration to specify rendering parameters.

## Usage

To use the Raytracer Epitech, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project's Git repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/raytracer).
2. Compile the project by running the build script (./build.sh) in the root directory.
3. Execute the generated executable with `./raytracer` and follow the instructions to specify the scene to render.
4. The rendering will be saved to an image file unless you specify the -sfml option, in which case the image will be rendered in an SFML window.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the raytracer.
- `docs/`: Contains the project documentation.
